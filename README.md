## Hotwire Integration (Turbo + Stimulus)
This application uses Hotwire to provide a seamless, fast, and dynamic user experience  without needing much custom JavaScript.

The Articles section has been updated to use turbo-rails:

 - Turbo Drive: It's a feature of the Hotwire framework in Rails, designed to speed up page navigation by preventing full page reloads (includes links and forms).

 - Partial Replacement: When a new article is created or an existing one is updated, the relevant part of the page (just that article or list) updates without refreshing the whole view.

 - Turbo Frames: Each article is wrapped inside a Turbo Frame (turbo_frame_tag dom_id(article)) so that editing or deleting only affects that row.

- Turbo Streams: The controller responds with Turbo Stream to update DOM elements on successful actions.

- For real-time updates, redis is being added, models should have callbacks which broadcast messages and these msgs can be listened/subscribed by views using `turbo_stream_from`.
